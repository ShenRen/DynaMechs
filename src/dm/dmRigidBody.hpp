This class is the repository for all the dynamic parameters for rigid bodies
(links) that are needed for the AB dynamics algorithm.  It is subclassed
from  dmLink  and subclassed by all links that have degrees of freedom to
be simulated.  Remember:  dmLink  is a misleading name as it specifies the
API needed by the AB algorithm and could also correspond to non-variable
transformations like the  dmZScrewTxLink  class that is only used for
kinematic manipulation (transformations), but do not have a physical
manifestation.

The \b setInertiaParameters and \b getInertiaParameters functions is used
set and retrieve the inertial parameters.  The first argument specifies the
mass, \f$m\f$, of the body, the second specifies the \f$3\times 3\f$ inertia matrix,
\f$\bar{\mbox{\boldmath $I$}}\f$, of the body with respect to the body's coordinate
system, and the third specifies the position of the body's center of gravity,
\f$\mbox{\boldmath $p$}_{cg}\f$, with respect to the body's coordinate system
origin.  Note that from these parameters, the \b setInertiaParameters
function constructs the spatial inertial matrix from the mass, center of
gravity and inertia tensor and verifies that it is positive definite:
\f[
{\bf I}  =  \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    \bar{\mbox{\boldmath $I$}} &
                  m\:\tilde{\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}_{cg} \\
    m\:\tilde{\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}^T_{cg}  &  m{\bf 1}_3
  \end{array} \right].
\f]
Note that \f$\bar{\mbox{\boldmath $I$}}\f$ is related to the body's inertia about
its principle axes, \f$\bar{\mbox{\boldmath $I$}}_{cg}\f$, as follows:
\f[
\bar{\mbox{\boldmath $I$}}   = 
   \mbox{\boldmath $R$}^T
            \bar{\mbox{\boldmath $I$}}_{cg}
                              \mbox{\boldmath $R$} +
   m \tilde{\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}_{cg} \tilde{\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}_{cg}^T,
\f]
where \f$\mbox{\boldmath $R$}\f$ specifies the rotation between the principle axes
and the body's coordinate system.

Note that for underwater simulation, an entirely new library is made with the
\b DM_HYDRODYNAMICS environment variable defined.  In this case, this class
requires additional hydrodynamic parameters to compute the additional
hydrodynamic effects.  These are set with the \b setHydrodynamicParameters
function.  The \b volume parameter is the volume of fluid that this rigid
body displaces.  The \b I_added_mass parameter is a \f$6\times 6\f$ positive
semi-definite matrix corresponding to the added mass.  The third parameter,
\b cb_pos is the position of the center of bouyancy with the respect to the
body's coordinate system.  The remaining parameters are used to compute a rough
approximation of a drag force.  In this algorithm, the body must be
approximated with an axis aligned cylinder.  The \b drag_axis indicates
which axis (0 for x axis, 1 for y, or 2 for z), \b cyl_min and \b
cyl_max gives the coordinates along this axis which defines the extent of the
approximating cylinder, and \b cyl_radius defines its radius.  Finally,
\b C_d defines the coefficient of drag.

This discussion requires the obvious note about units.  DynaMechs makes no
assumptions about length and mass units (only their consistency).  It is
required that once a convention is chosen (MKS, cgs, etc..), it is adhered to
in the specification of ALL the parameters in all of the classes.

Motion of rigid bodies can be under the influence of a variety of external
forces.  Complaint forces (a function of the rigid body's state) can be
implemented by subclassing from  dmForce  and "adding" instantiations of
them to this class.  The  dmContactModel  is an example of a derived force
class.  Any number of previously instantiated  dmForce  objects can be
added to the  dmRigidBody class using the \b addForce function.
The number of force objects associated with this class is returned when a call
to \b getNumForces  is made.

Force objects are added to an internal list in order such that the first one is
index 0, the second is index 1, and so forth.  The current index of a force
object in the list of associated objects is returned when a call to \b
getForceIndex is made and the pointer to a  dmForce  object, in question,
is provided.  Alternatively a pointer to a force object is returned when a call
to \b getForce is made with a given index.  This function returns NULL if
the index is out of range (\c 0,\c .., \c num_forces-1).

Force objects can be removed with a call to either \b removeForce function,
which will return true if the operation is successful.  The force to be removed
can be referenced either by its index or a pointer.  If the index is out of
range or the pointer doesn't match any of the current force objects in the
list, or there was an internal failure, the function will return false.  Note
that when a force object is removed all indices for forces added later than the
one in question will be renumbered (one lower).

In addition to the force objects, this class also provides the functions, \b 
setExternalForce and \b getExternalForce, which can be used to directly
specify an external force exerted on the rigid body.  The parameter, \b 
force, is a spatial vector consisting of the moment and linear force expressed
with respect to the body's coordinate system.

The \b computeBeta, and, in the case of hydrodynamic simulation, \b 
computeDrag and \b computeHydrodynamicBias  are all functions called by the
\b ABForwardKinematics  functions of the various derived objects to compute
state (position and velocity) dependent bias forces experience by the bodies.
