/**

The dmLink class is an abstract base class for all derived link classes.
Its main purpose is to support polymorphism across all link classes by
providing the virtual interfaces for all the functions that the dmArticulation
class calls in the course of simulating the system.  As such,
nearly all functions specified in the public section are pure virtual functions
that must be defined in the derived link classes (currently, dmMDHLink,
dmSphericalLink, dmQuaternionLink, dmMobileBaseLink, and dmZScrewTxLink).

The link's state variables (generalized position and velocity variables) can be
set and retrieved using the \b setState and \b getState functions.  The
\b q and \b qd arguments correspond to position and velocity,
respectively.  They are arrays containing $n$ elements where $n$ is the number
of degrees of freedom for this particular type of link (and determined by the
derived classes).  This number is returned when the \b getNumDOFs function
is called.  The joint input vector (containing motor inputs where applicable,
but usually generalized joint forces) can be set by calling \b setJointInput.  
The parameter is also an array of \b getNumDOFs elements
containing the desired values.

A coulomb friction parameter can also be specified and retrieved using the \b 
setJointFriction and \b getJointFriction functions.  This scalar parameters
multiplies the joint velocity to produce a force/torque opposing the direction
of motion as follows:
\f[
\tau \: = \: \mu_c \: \dot{q}.
\f]

For dynamics simulation of the link using the AB algorithm, a number of
transformation functions are required of all link types.  Their functions are
listed as follows:
\f[
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
{\tt rtxToInboard}  &  & $^{i-1}f_i = {^iR}^T_{i-1} \: f_i$ \\
{\tt rtxFromInboard}     && $^{i}\omega_{i-1} = {^iR}_{i-1} \: \omega_{i-1}$ \\
{\tt stxToInboard}       && $^{i-1}{\bf f}_i = {^iX}^T_{i-1} \: {\bf f}_i$ \\
{\tt stxFromInboard}     && $^i{\bf v}_{i-1} = {^iX}_{i-1} \: {\bf v}_{i-1}$ \\
{\tt rcongtxToInboardSym}&& $^{i-1}\bar{I}_i =
                      {^iR}^T_{i-1} \: \bar{I}_i \: {^iR}_{i-1}$ \\
{\tt rcongtxToInboardGen}&& $^{i-1}G_i =
                      {^iR}^T_{i-1} \: G_i \: {^iR}_{i-1}$ \\
{\tt scongtxToInboardIrefl} && $^{i-1}{\bf N}_i =
                      {^i{X}}^T_{i-1} \: {\bf N}_i \: {^i{X}}_{i-1}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\f]

The first two rotate Cartesian vectors between this link's and the inboard
(parent) link's coordinate systems, while the second two transform (rotate and
translate) spatial vectors.  The last three functions perform congruence
transformations on matrices to the inboard coordinate system.  \b
rcongtxToInboardSym affects a rotational congruence transform on sysmmetric
$3\times 3$ matrices while its counterpart, \b rcongtxToInboardGen,
transforms general \f$3\times 3\f$ matrices.  The last function, \b
scongtxToInboardIrefl, is a specialized function for the AB algorithm which
efficiently transforms \f$6\times 6\f$ reflected articulated-body inertia matrices
taking into account special structure of the matrix based on its joint axes.
This one function is the centerpiece of the efficiency of this implementation
of the AB algorithm.

The next four functions are used to perform the three recursions of the AB
simulation algorithm.  The first forward kinematics recursion is implemented
for each link with the \b ABForwardKinematics function.  This function
should only be called by dmArticulation::ABForwardKinematics <em> yeah,
this should be private and dmArticulation should be made a friend</em>.
Again, the \b q and \b qd parameters are the joint position and velocity
vectors computed by the current interation of the numerical integration
algorithm and are used to set the new state of the link.  The \b
link_val_inboard is the \b ABForKinStruct (see dmArticulation) that
has been filled with the values for the inboard link's state dependent
quantities.  Using these values, the \b link_val_curr struct elements are
computed for this link.

The second backward recursion of the AB algorithm is implemented with two
different functions for reasons of efficiency.  If this link has no children,
it is a leaf node in the tree structure, and therefore, the 
dmArticulation::ABBackwardDynamics function will call the \b
ABBackwardDynamicsN function which will begin the recursion which requires
less computation, by computing \b f_star_inboard and \b
N_refl_inboard, the AB bias force and inertia that are reflected across this
link's joint and transformed to the inboard link's coordinate system.  The
function \b ABBackwardDynamics performs a full recursive step for a link
with children.  It takes the accumulated results of the child links in \b
f_star_curr and \b N_refl_curr and computes the same quantities as
before.  The \b ABForKinStruct parameter is the \b link_val_curr
computed in the first pass, and is used to call dmForce::computeForce()
functions if they have been added to the associated dmRigidBody.

The third forward recursion of the AB algorithm is implemented in the \b
ABForwardAcceleration function.  Its input parameter, \b a_inboard is the
spatial acceleration of the inboard link.  This function computes and outputs
the spatial acceleration of this link in \b a_curr and fills in the
derivative of state variables (\b qd and \b qdd).  Note that the velocity
vector, \b qd, is not necessarily the same as that used in \b
ABForwardKinematics.  Rather, it contains the time derivatives of \b q.
See dmSphericalLink for an example where they are not the same.

Another set of four functions are required for simulating systems with
kinematic loops.  Three of these function are used in the backward dynamics
recursion of the AB algorithm.  The \b XikToInboard function is used when
eliminating a link from the force-balance equation of its predecessor.  This
function computes the update to the coefficient of the loop-closure constraint
forces of a loop in the predecessor link's force-balance equation (as a result
of the elimination).  The \b BtoInboard function computes the new
coefficient of loop n's constraint forces in the loop-closure constraint
equation for loop k after elimination of the current link in favor of its
predecessor.  The \b xformZetak function computes the new bias term
($\zeta_k$) in loop k's loop-closure constraint equation after elimination of
the link.  Finally, the last function, \b ABForwardAccelerations, is used
in the forward accelerations recursion of the AB algorithm.  It is an
overloaded version of the same function used for tree topologies, requiring
additional parameters containing topology information and computed
loop-closure forces.

Two functions, \b pushForceStates and \b popForceStates, save and
restore the state of all dmForce objects attached to the link.  These
functions are provided for adaptive-stepsize integrators which may need to
back out of an integration step.

Another two functions are provided for retrieving the energy of a link.  The
\b getPotentialEnergy function returns the gravitational potential energy of
the link based on the supplied gravity vector and the \b ABForKinStruct
parameter for the link.  The potential energy zero is defined by the plane
passing through the origin of the inertial coordinate system with the gravity
vector as its normal.  The \b getKineticEnergy function returns the kinetic
energy of the link (translational + rotational) based on the supplied \b
ABForKinStruct parameter.

The only function that is implemented in this class is the \b
forwardKinematics function.  It is called by 
dmArticulation::forwardKinematics function and computes the current link's
position (\b link_val_curr->p_ICS) and orientation (\b
link_val_curr->R_ICS) with respect to the inertial coordinate frame given
the inboard link's position and orientation (\b link_val_inboard->p_ICS
and \b link_val_inboard->R_ICS).
