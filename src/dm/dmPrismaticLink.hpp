/**

This class is one of the two concrete link classes derived from the 
dmMDHLink class.  It implements the dynamics specific to a prismatic
(translational) one degree of freedom joint.

<b>Not reference manual material:</b> The primary purpose of this class is to
implement the \b scongToInboardIrefl member function, a very efficient
congruence transformation of the Articulated-Body inertia matrix that is
transformed across the prismatic joint.  In this case, the sixth row and column
of the matrix are zero and taking this into account results in significant
computation savings (for all the gorey details, please read my dissertation or
Robotics and Automation Journal article).  The 
dmMDHLink::ABBackwardDynamics[N] functions call this function in the course of
computing the dynamics.  It should probably be a private/protected member
function, but since it does not modify any member variables there is no harm in
leaving it public.
