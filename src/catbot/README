A tip for using the Eclipse CDT

If you want to run the kurmet executable by simply clicking the 'run' button in Eclipse, you need to

1. go to 'run configureations' of kurmet
2. go to arguments tab
3. uncheck the 'Use default' checkbox
4. change the 'working directory' to
   "[your_path]/DynaMechs/src/kurmet", since all the configuration files that the kurmet executable requires to run are there.  

If you don't use the IDE, you need to manually copy the executable file to that directory. However, this is not a very good practice for out-of-source building.
